# SAM2 Tiny Core ML

SAM 2 (Segment Anything in Images and Videos), is a collection of foundation models from FAIR that aim to solve promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. See the [SAM 2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714) for more information.

This is the Core ML version of [SAM 2 Tiny](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2-hiera-tiny), and is suitable for use with the [SAM2 Studio demo app](https://github.com/huggingface/sam2-swiftui). It was converted in `float16` precision using [this fork](https://github.com/huggingface/segment-anything-2/tree/coreml-conversion) of the original code repository.

## Download

Install `huggingface-cli`

```bash
brew install huggingface-cli

```
